            2. Although introduced originally from China, Japan has created an entire cult-like obsession making ramen anything but simple.<br>
            3. In Japan, ramen shops and ramen making are considered a culinary art and Japanese people line up for hours to try a bowl made by a master ramen chef.<br> 
            4. Some ramen restaurants are so popular, there are line-ups hours before the shop is even open.<br>
            5. Ramen in Japan is also quite diverse with different kinds of broths, toppings and noodle styles as well as regional variations.<br> 
            6. Different areas, cities, and even shops have their own twist on ramen preparation and ingredients making each ramen experience different and unique.<br></p>
